# Google Capstone (Track 1)

Welcome to my first case study with R! I've recently just started learning R as part of the Coursera: Google Data Analytics Certification Course. I have published
two notebooks as part of the capstone projects assigned to us in the course. Even though these notebooks are published, I aim to come back to these case studies to
further improve my analysis as I learn more about data analytics and statistics! I will also be uploading a Tableau dashboard soon so stay tuned! :)
